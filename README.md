# TVXS-web
*An ultra simple Android app which opens a url*

I wanted to build an app, different from the standard Bookmark Android app, that would open a url that I am frequently visiting these days [greferendum].
Tried to mess with the icon too.

I do not own tvxs.gr and I am not associated with it in any way.
